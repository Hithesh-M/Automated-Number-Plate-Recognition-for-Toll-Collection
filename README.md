ABSTRACT

Our innovative toll booth system uses advanced computer vision for automated license plate recognition. 
This technology ensures high accuracy, streamlines toll collection, reduces wait times, and minimizes human errors, significantly boosting efficiency. 
By automating the identification process, the system enhances overall road efficiency and provides a seamless experience for drivers. 
This modernization of toll collection paves the way for a smarter and more efficient transportation infrastructure.


PROBLEM STATEMENT

The current FAS Tag system is vulnerable to misuse, as tags can be easily copied and used 
by unauthorized individuals. This poses a security risk, as toll amounts are not securely 
confined within the system but are accessible to third parties.


OBJECTIVE

****To ensure a secure and efficient toll collection process by employing image 
processing for license plate recognition for swift, accurate transactions, reducing 
wait times and minimizing the risk of misuse.
****To establish a secure infrastructure, enhancing both operational efficiency and user 
confidence in toll booth transactions.

WORKING

The number plate will be detected and extracted by performing following operations:
1). Image Capturing
2). Grayscale Conversion
3). Bilateral Filtering
4). Canny Edge Detection
5). Drawing lines on Edges
6). Number plate detection
7). Number plate extraction using OCR
